    <h1>Awesome Things</h1>
    <p>Since you might already know where my heart lies religiously, no need to explain that again. I love computer science and medicine and especially when the two intertwine in studies such as bioinformatics, the field I desire A degree in. I love cooking, and I recently discovered again that I love spicy food. I spend my days playing games online and talking to friends when i'm not busy with work of some kind or whatever, I wish to master programming languages such as python, R and julia for data anaylsis. I am also going to train for pharmacy technician certification in the near future, as well as cybersecurity certs.</p>
